This is a PPM-injector for the MWii projekt.
Se it as a Raw Beta.

Scetch can be used with Preversions for MultiWiiConf_V2

Things needed
Arduino PRO mini
Gyro
ACC

The PPM injector works fine
Some more work is needed with the controls.
Make more accurate......
Implement MAG etc.
GUI PID:s

It's done Using only accSmooth from roll and pitch.
Mag is probibly best but acc is easier to do.

Tilt head sideways to control PAN.
Back & Forward to control TILT.

To Setup....
Select PWM pin to send PPM sinal from.

Setup your TX settings.

Adjust PID settings to match headmovemoents with AXP ( In  HT-file )
increase to give bigger throws.
