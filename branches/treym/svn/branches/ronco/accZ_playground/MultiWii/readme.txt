
please use the current MWC bversion!


WMC with ProMicro support

based on r567

- Output seem to work
- vBat works
- Sensors seem to work
- USB communication with GUI works
- RX input works
- Spectrum Satelite with UART1 works

NOTE
dont mess with serial or USB registers if you dont have possibility to reflash the bootloader!
if you do something wrong with it you cant upload skatches with the USB anymore (I had to reflash it a serval times -.-)
