  # How it works

= Hardware =
You need to connect a piezo buzzer or a pilotlamp to the dedicated buzzer port of you FC.

= Software =

In config.h you need to alter one of the following lines:

#define BUZZER

#define PILOTLAMP

to enable the buzzer.

= How it works =

There are several mandatory and optional beeping patterns to indicate the different states of the MultWii system. The patternn consist of 3 beeps followed by a pause. The length of the beeps and pauses are defined as follows:
 * N: None (0ms)
 * S: Short (50ms)
 * L: Long (200ms)
 * D: Double (2000ms)

The beeps are priority driven, the first entry has the highest priority:
 
 # *Failsafe find me signal:* LNN,D (repeat)
 # *Failsafe landing active:* SLL,S  (repeat)  
 # *GPS RTH/ PH activated without fix:* SSN,S (repeat)   
 # *Beeper:* SSS,S (repeat)
 # *Runtime Warning:* SSS,N (repeat)  (#define ARMEDTIMEWARNING)
 # *Battery voltage warning level 3:* SLL,D (repeat)
 # *Battery voltage warning level 2:* SSL,D (repeat)
 # *Battery voltage warning level 1:* SLN,D (repeat)
 # *RCoptions Toggle:* S   (#define RCOPTIONSBEEP)
Additional beeps
 * *Inflight ACC calibration activated:* SS (#define INFLIGHT_ACC_CALIBRATION)
 * *Inflight ACC calibration deactivated:* SSS
 * *Gyro calibration done:* SSS
 * *ACC calibration done:* L
 * *LCD Configuration step:* S
