#summary How to use the Pilotlamp.
#labels Documentation,Feature

= Introduction =

The PilotLampis used to give the pilot even more feedback of the functions and errors of the MultiWii system than the buzzer alone.

  # Hardware setup
  # Software setup
  # How it works

= Hardware =
You need to connect the pilotlamp to the dedicated buzzer port of your FC and to 5V and ground.

= Software =

In config.h you need to alter the following line:

#define PILOTLAMP

to enable the pilot lamp.

= How it works =

*LEDs*

There are three different colors on the pilot light:red, green and blue.

 * Red: error indicator
 * Green: Flight mode indicator
 * GPS function indicator

 * Armed, acro mode: green LED medium blinking 2x
 * Armed, angle mode: green LED slow blinking 3x
 * Armed, horizon mode: green LED medium blinking 3x

*Blue LED*
 * GPS present: No GPS fix: fast blinking
 * GPS present: Valid Fix: slow short blinking
 * GPS present: RTH/PH active: slow long blinking

*Red LED*
 * Failsafe landing active: fast blinking
 * Failsafe find me: slow blinking

*Beeper*
 * Sequence RED->BLUE->GREEN (repeat)

*IÂ²C*
 * All colors blink at the same time, buzzer sounds*
*Buzzer*

There are several mandatory and optional beeping patterns to indicate the different states of the MultWii system. The patternn consist of 3 beeps followed by a pause. The length of the beeps and pauses are defined as follows:
 * N: None (0ms)
 * S: Short (50ms)
 * L: Long (200ms)
 * D: Double (2000ms)

The beeps are priority driven, the first entry has the highest priority:
 
 # *Failsafe find me signal:* LNN,D (repeat)
 # *Failsafe landing active:* SLL,S  (repeat)  
 # *GPS RTH/ PH activated without fix:* SSN,S (repeat)   
 # *Beeper:* SSS,S (repeat)
 # *Runtime Warning:* SSS,N (repeat)  (#define ARMEDTIMEWARNING)
 # *Battery voltage warning level 3:* SLL,D (repeat)
 # *Battery voltage warning level 2:* SSL,D (repeat)
 # *Battery voltage warning level 1:* SLN,D (repeat)
 # *RCoptions Toggle:* S   (#define RCOPTIONSBEEP)
Additional beeps
 * *Inflight ACC calibration activated:* SS (#define INFLIGHT_ACC_CALIBRATION)
 * *Inflight ACC calibration deactivated:* SSS
 * *Gyro calibration done:* SSS
 * *ACC calibration done:* L
 * *LCD Configuration step:* S
