Quick guide:
1 - Upload LEDring.ino onto LEDring board
2 - If Multiwii version 2.1, replace led.ino with update one from link above and update
3 - Connect up I2C, 5v and GND between boards

If you haven't programmed a LEDring before, you will probably need to update your Arduino environment. See link above.
